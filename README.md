This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: improper error handling during file processing. The `bug.sh` script iterates through a list of files and attempts to process them. If an error occurs (e.g. a file doesn't exist), it silently continues instead of reporting the error or stopping. The `bugSolution.sh` script addresses this by using proper error checking and handling.
